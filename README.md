The main idea behind this project was to translate a large and complex data set (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/hurdat2.html) which contained 57229 lines of every storm entry recorded since 1851 to present, into a user friendly application that would best display the impact of climate change on frequency and sizes of hurricanes in the USA.
